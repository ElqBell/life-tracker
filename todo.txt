calorie and nutrients counter(data from some api about every food and drink), but
if it doesnt exist or even if it does, add ability to write your own calories
or edit the suggested, but don't make user count every calorie,

is 214 calories and they also input that they ate
250g and automatically calculate nutrients,calories, vitamins...

show daily how much necessary vitamins/minerals they need,
if they eat enough and all.
